# GitHub - Delete commits history with git commands

# Clone the project, e.g. `myproject` is my project repository:

git clone https://github.com/usmanweb/myproject

# Since all of the commits history are in the `.git` folder, we have to remove it:

cd myproject

# And delete the `.git` folder:

git rm -rf .git

# Now, re-initialize the repository:

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/usmanweb/myproject.git
git remote -v

# Add all the files and commit the changes:

git add --all
git commit -am "Initial commit"

# Force push update to the master branch of our project repository:
git push -f origin master
